				        <h1>Introduction and Background</h1>
					<h2>Study Site - Waties Island, SC</h2>
				        <p>South Carolina’s “Grand Strand” is an uninterrupted 60 mile stretch of white sandy beaches, seaside resorts, and golf courses along the state’s northeastern coast.  At the northern terminus of this vacation paradise lies Waties Island, an undeveloped barrier island which exists as part of a broader conservation and research easement along the Little River neck.</p>
				       	<p>Waties Island is bound by two inlets, Hog Inlet, which separates the island from Cherry Grove Beach to the south and Little River Inlet to the north, which serves as the SC-NC state boundary and separates the island form Sunset Beach. The island’s central axis is oriented approximately 72 degrees east of north and is the first in a chain of barrier islands that begin in northeastern half of Long Bay.</p>
					<p>As with most barrier islands in the southeast, the sediments which comprise the island began accumulating 6,000 – 10,000 years ago during the Holocene epoch. This period in geologic time is characterized by rapidly rising sea levels as ice from the last glacial maximum began to melt. While rising seas began to inundate the continental shelf on the east coast around 16,000 years ago, global climate began to stabilize during the Holocene and thus a gentler rise in sea level facilitated the accumulation of coastal sediments into the barrier islands present today. </p> 
					<p>Small variations in sea level can shift barrier island complexes landward and seaward, known as regressive (island moving offshore) and transgressive (island moving inland) cycles. Evidence of these shifts can be seen in LiDAR imagery of the island where paleo beach ridges and dune fields are observed parallel to the island’s modern coast. </p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 1. LiDAR and Aerial Imagery of Waties Island, SC. LiDAR is a geospatial mapping technique and is an acronym for Light Detection And Ranging, where point elevations are compiled into a matrix known as a point cloud.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>The result of the island’s foundational geology is a mosaic of unique habitats and landscapes including interdunal swale, maritime forest, salt marsh, brackish swamps, and a significant estuarine environment known as Dunn Sound. These environments are created by a combination of geological, hydrological, and ecological factors that allow plant and animal species to become exceptionally adapted to their surroundings. For example, Spartina alterniflora, the species which dominates the lower reaches of saltmarshes tolerates highly saline waters, while woody species which inhabit uplands such as Live oak (Quercus virginiana) and Eastern Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) require fresher waters and may experience stress or death when exposed to saltier waters.</p>
					<p>If we shift our view of barrier islands away from an ecological perspective and more towards a hydrogeological perspective, the species which inhabit each region of the island can provide clues and insight into the physical characteristics of the geology and groundwater under the surface.</p> 
				   
					<h2>Barrier Island Hydrology</h2>
					<p>Hydrogeology is a field which deals with the interactions of water and sediment. Often it investigates how inputs and outputs of water interact with the sediment and material in the environment. Examples of hydrogeologic studies could include evaluating how fast stormwater will percolate into a retention pond or monitoring the extraction of groundwater from large aquifers. Most hydrogeologic studies focus on interactions between humans and the environment such as the previously mentioned examples, however there is a growing body of literature investigating how groundwaters interact with the natural environment. The motivation for such studies is to better understand processes that involve groundwaters, such as nutrient exchange, the dissolution of some bedrocks which create sinkholes, or to understand how changes in the hydrologic cycle will affect ecosystems. On barrier islands, hydrogeologic studies often focus on understanding what creates freshwater on the island, and how those fresh waters move and interact with the subterranean environment until they end up in the coastal ocean.</p>
					<p>A simplified hydrogeologic model of southeastern barrier islands is pictured below.</p>
					 <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"> <!-- Add a margin-bottom to create space -->
					    <figure>
					    <img src="images/WatiesIslandHydroModel.png" alt="Description of your image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-height: 800px;">  
					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 2. A simplified conceptual model of barrier island hydrogeology. Single arrows represent inputs of freshwater into the system while double arrows represent areas where salt and fresh groundwaters mix and exchange.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>In these environments groundwaters can exist in two basic forms, a traditional aquifer, which is confined between impermeable layers in the earth, known as aquitards, or as a freshwater lens which is a “bubble” of fresh water that may rest atop saltier water or an aquitard. The most common origin of freshwater on barrier islands is from rain or “meteoric waters”. It’s been suggested that sand dunes are the area where this rainwater infiltrates the ground the easiest due to the high permeability of sands. Additionally, this region is typically the highest elevation of a barrier island, resulting in the areas where the water table will be at its highest elevation. This point is often referred to as the top hydraulic head on the island or the point at which groundwaters will flow away from due to gravity. From the dunes, groundwater may move towards the ocean through the beach or towards the marsh through the island. The beach face is a known area of groundwater exchange, where freshwaters mix with seawater within the sandy sediments. The alternate path of groundwater is more complex. In the case of Waties Island, freshwater at the dune may drain to the brackish swamp in the core of the island, where the island’s water table is exposed due to low elevation. However, the water table extends into the maritime forest on the landward side of the island where it is used by woody plants and trees. As the elevation of the maritime forest gives way to the saltmarsh, groundwater flow becomes increasingly complex. Highly permeable sands in the maritime forest transition into much finer silt and mud typical of the saltmarsh. These marsh sediments are notably low permeability soils, blocking the lateral and vertical movement of groundwater. Yet groundwaters are able continue their flow path towards the marsh. How is this possible? Fine scall geologic differences created by a process known as overwash provide highly permeable “plumbing” for groundwaters to infiltrate the marsh. What is overwash? Overwash occurs when coastal storms or hurricanes create waves significant enough to overtop or erode sand dunes and push those sandy sediments back into the island. </p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 3. An example of an overwash fan in the modern coastal environment.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					  </div>
					<p>These relic overwash fans exist within the geology of the marsh and result in nonhomogeneous transport and mixing between estuarine and fresh groundwaters in the saltmarsh. We can further complicate this transport by adding factors such as tidal forcing, which can reverse the flow of groundwater at higher tides or accelerate the flow during low tides. Other factors that can affect groundwater flow through the marsh include evapotranspiration, seasonal demands by plants, and of course human modification such as constructing sea walls or roads. </p>
					<h2>Why Study This?</h2>
					<p>The hydrogeologic scene on barrier islands is complex and nuanced, requiring expertise in a variety of fields, so why are studies here important? Understanding the “plumbing” of barrier islands is essential to painting a complete picture of the ecosystem services these environments provide. For example, it may be apparent that a barrier island serves as just that, a barrier to protect coastal communities from the brunt of storm damage and coastal hazards. However, if climactic changes such as sea level rise threaten to increase the amount of salty groundwater in the island, keystone flora such as oak and pine trees may die-off, threatening to destabilize the island and reduce its protective services to coastal communities. Additionally, characterizing and quantifying the groundwaters flowing through island allows researchers to better understand the importance of groundwater for transporting nutrients from the wetlands of the island into the estuary and coastal ocean, providing foundational nutrition for the food chain in these environments. Barrier island hydrogeological studies can also serve as small scale experiments and studies for much larger coastal aquifer systems. Saltwater intrusion is one of the foremost threats to the coastal aquifers that supply municipalities and cities with freshwater resources. Increasing sea level increases the force that salty groundwater pushes into freshwater regions on the coastal plain. Coupling this with increasing urbanization and demand for freshwater from these systems creates the potential for widespread salinization of aquifers, diminishing their value as a utility. </p>

				        <h1>Methods</h1>
					<h2>Site Transects</h2>
					<p>While several studies have focused on studying the interactions of fresh, island groundwater and salty, ocean waters on the beach face or creek bank, few have attempted to characterize the mixing occurring within the transition from maritime forest to saltmarsh. Here, underground mixing of waters should be apparent as salty water is forced through the marsh sediments by the tide until it reaches the fresh water flowing off the island due to gravity. In order to characterize the geology and attempt to capture the properties of groundwater as it traverses this boundary, we have to bring the study to a two dimensional level. To do this we have established three transects or lines where we will study the subsurface of the island. </p>
					 <div style="margin-bottom: 40px;"> <!-- Add a margin-bottom to create space -->
					    <figure>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 5. Aerial and LiDAR imagery of the study site. White lines indicate transect lines, Red “X’s” indicate groundwater well locations, and white circles indicate geologic core locations.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					  </div>
					<p>Transect X covers to transition from high elevation to low elevation saltmarsh, transect Y provides high resolution insight into the high marsh and transect Z spans the transition from maritime forest to high elevation saltmarsh.</p>
					<h2>Groundwater Wells</h2>
					<p>Knowing the elevation of the water table through time at different points along the transects not only allows for the characterization of the shape of the water table but also reveals environmental signals, such as tidal forcing or the impact of storms. To get these water table measurements, three groundwater wells were installed along transect Z with one well in each ecological zone, maritime forest, high marsh, and low marsh. The wells are made of 3/4'” PVC pipe with a 2 1/2” interval of slotted screen at the end to allow for groundwater to enter the pipe. At each site a hole was dug with post hole diggers until the water table was hit an the hole would begin to collapse. At that point a larger PVC pipe was inserted to keep the excavation open and further depth was achived wtith a hand auger. Due to the marsh sites containing fine grained muds and silts that could clog the well screen, the well point was placed in the excavation and backfilled with beach sand to act as a buffer. Each wellpoint was installed into the freshwater lens, aka. water table, so that water table elevations could be recorded. In the center of transect Y a set of smaller wells were installed. Unlike the wells on transect Z these wells were installed in the same location, the center of the transect, but at different depths to evaluate how groundwater characteristic might change within different layers of sediment. </p>

					<h2>Geologic Description</h2>
					<p>Recognizing the influence that small-scale geologic features such as overwash fans may impose on the flow of groundwater, a robust description of the sediments contained in the study site is needed. To accomplish this, a vibracore is taken. Vibracoring is a method of extracting sediment from the subsurface by attaching a weighted vibrating head to the top of an aluminum core barrel. The vibrating head is powered by a gas engine typically used for finishing concrete. These concrete engines have a fitting that spins a flexible shaft that when used for concrete work, vibrates a screed and provides a fine smooth finish. In a geotechnical setting, rather than a screed, the shaft spins a counterweight that creates intense vibrations along the length of the core barrel. When these vibrations reach the ground, liquefaction occurs, and the core barrel easily slides into the earth until a point of refusal is reached. </p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 8. Vibracore operations prior to starting the generator, note the weighted vibrating head clamped high on the core barrel.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>Once the core barrel has reached its final depth, the vibrating head is removed and excess core barrel is cut off prior to retrieving the core. Water is added to the top of the core until it reaches the top of the barrel. A screw lock pressure cap is applied to the core barrel to pull a vacuum on the core’s contents. Now the core is able to be retrieved by pulling it out of the earth vertically using a come-along winch centered above the barrel with a tripod.</p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 9. Retrieving core C5 from the high marsh using a come-along winch.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>Once the core has been removed from the ground, fast action is necessary to cap the opposite end of the core barrel to ensure contents remain in place. Finally, the core barrel is hauled away to be further processed at the lab.</p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 10. Hauling off core C4 after capping both ends.</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>In total, five cores were taken from the study site, four along transect Z, and one in the middle of transect Y. A core was retrieved from each ecological zone; low marsh, high marsh, and maritime forest. Due to the high marsh representing the greatest mixing zone between salty and fresh groundwaters, three cores were taken at various locations to ensure adequate geologic description. Basic descriptions of each core included describing soil color and texture at each layer, and noting the presence of fossils or other anomalies. Further analysis included subsampling the core at 15 centimeter intervals to analyze the percent water content, percent organic matter, and grain size of the material. To ascertain values of percent water content and organics, sediment was first loaded into small crucibles weighed, and dried for 24 hours at 221 degrees Fahrenheit. Samples were reweighed and the percent difference attributed to lost water content. Next the samples were placed in a muffle furnace and fired at 1,022 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours to render any organic material to ash. Again, the samples were reweighed and percent difference in weight attributed to loss of organic material. </p>

One half is archived and the other half is labeled working. Basic soil characteristics are described, like color and texture. The Munsell company is the geologic standard for describing soil color and uses color chips with windows to help describe the soil color. After the basic description is complete, subsampling occurs every 15cm for fine-scale analyses.</figcaption>

					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>To prepare samples for grain size analysis, organic matter must be removed. Hydrogen peroxide was added to the sediment in a beaker and agitated. This reaction was allowed to continue overnight before excess hydrogen peroxide was removed by boiling the sample on a hotplate. Next, shell material needed to be stripped from the sample. Since shells contain mostly carbonate structures an acid wash of 10% sulfuric acid removed this material from the sediment. After continuing overnight, the acid was diluted with deionized water and washed out of the sample by a process of centrifuging and further diluting the sample. Finally, samples were ready to be analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer. This method uses an optical laser to detect obscuration values (how much the laser’s light is obscured i.e. bigger grains, bigger obscuration) which is more accurate than traditional methods of passing the sediment through a series of fine sieves to obtain percent grain sizes. Grain size analysis is essential for geologic description as it is the gold standard for objective characterization of geologic components. </p>
					<h2>Permeameter Tests</h2>
					<p>Piggybacking off the prior analyses, falling head permeameter tests are used as a laboratory method of characterizing how groundwater flows through specific types of sediment. Major soil classifications identified by the grain size analysis were subjected to a permeameter test. A falling head permeameter is a benchtop device that has a tall, graduated chamber connected to another chamber at a higher elevation by a hose. The sediment sample is loaded into the graduated chamber and tamped down to closely resemble the in-situ geology of the site. A volume of water is added to higher chamber which creates the “head”. The tube between the two chambers is opened and the head begins to “fall” through the sample. This operation is timed and continues until the head has been recovered after passing through the sediment sample. This yields a value with units of volume over time. Once the volume of water and volume of sediment is reconciled the final measurement contains units of distance over time, essentially speed. This speed value is known as hydraulic conductivity and is critical for the next analysis, calculations of Darcy’s Law.</p>
					<h2>Darcy's Law</h2>
					<p>Henry Darcy was a hydraulic engineer who existed during the 19th century. He hailed from Dijon, France, the birthplace of Dijon mustard, and is notably remembered for his law that describes the relationship between a fluid and its movement through a porous medium. </p>

					    <figcaption style="margin-top: 25px;">Figure 13. Darcy’s Law, (Q) represents the volumetric flow of fluid through a porous material, (K) is hydraulic conductivity of the porous material, ascertained from the prior permeameter tests, (A) represents the area where flow is being estimated, (dH/dL) is the gradient of hydraulic head or the slope of the water table. .</figcaption>
					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>For this application, Q will represent the rate estimation of groundwater movement between wells along transect Z. Term A will be the two-dimensional area of the well screen underground, dH is the recorded height of the water table within the well, while dL is the horizontal distance between the wells. This calculation will provide some rough estimates of Darcy flow at specific points in time, we can then track how major hydrogeologic forces like storms larger tides may accelerate or diminish groundwater movement.</p>
					<h2>Groundwater Analyses</h2>
					<p>We’ve mentioned water table elevation several times now without addressing how it will be measured. While measuring to the water table in the well could be accomplished with a simple tape measure, this does not provide high enough resolution that data that would be worth anyone’s time analyzing. Our 21st century approach is to deploy sensors underwater in the well that measure the pressure of the water above sensor. With some quick math to calculate the pressure of water and compensation to include the pressure of air, an accurate elevation measurement of the water table can be achieved. For this study we deployed three Solinst LTC5 leveloggers, and set them to take a record at every twenty minutes. In addition to water level, these sensors record water temperature and salinity. These measurements are not only valuable for Darcy’s Law calculations but will also contain the fingerprints of hydrogeologic forces such as rain and storm surge from major storm events and the effect of tides pushing the water within the marsh soils. In order to untangle these hydrogeologic forces a statistical method known as ensemble empirical mode decomposition can be used. This method uses a moving average to deconstruct the underlying signals comprised in the mother (original) signal. We can then parse through the output, known as residuals, to find sub-signals that align with tidal and precipitation records. </p>

					<h2>Electrical Resistivity</h2>
					<p>Electrical resistivity surveys were used as a geophysical tool to assist in imaging groundwater and identifying potential mixing zones across the study site transects. Electrical resistivity (ER) is a method that uses a series of electrodes and applied electric currents to measure the resistive properties of the earth. The electrodes are 56 stainless steel spikes inserted into the ground, and electricity is applied by a long cable with 56 graphite terminals spaced throughout. This apparatus is connected to a switchbox and main head unit which systematically selects a pair of electrodes in the array to make a measurement. Once selected, the first electrode receives electricity at a known voltage, and the second electrode in the pair waits to receive the remaining voltage as it passes through the ground. This setup is essentially creating a basic circuit that’s using the earth material underneath the survey as a resistor. The resulting datapoint is an “apparent resistive” value located along the arc the electrical current travels on between the two points. The head unit and switch box cycle through the entire 56 electrode array to create a matrix of apparent resistivities. </p>

					    </figure>
					 </div>
					<p>In traditional approaches, this method can be used to identify large buried objects, gaps or caves underground, large regions of conductive ore, or for groundwater exploration. When this technique is used in a saltmarsh environment, there are a few assumptions that must be made due to the conductive nature of saltwater and the overall saturation of the sediment. Here it’s believed that the resulting ER signal is sensitive to changes in geology, porosity, sediment texture, and salinity of waters within the sediment. We use this technique in a time series format, completing a survey monthly at the exact same point to identify any seasonal or event driven changes in the resistivity signal. Since the surveys are stationary through time, we control for any changes in geology, meaning any changes in resistivity signal must be due to the amount of groundwater in the subsurface or that salinity of that groundwater.</p>
